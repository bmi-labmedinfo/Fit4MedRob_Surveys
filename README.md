# Fit4MedRob_Surveys
Repository with code for the statistical analysis perfomed on Fit4MedRob surveys.

[Fit4MedRob](https://www.fit4medrob.it) is an Italian project aiming at revolutionizing current rehabilitation and assistive models for people of all ages with reduced or absent motor, sensory, or cognitive functions, by means of novel (bio)robotic and allied digital technologies and of continuum of care paradigms that can take advantage of the novel technologies in all the phases of the rehabilitation process, from the prevention up to the home care in the chronic phase



To understand stakeholders needs and their perception about robotics-assisted rehabilitation, we have implemented different types of surveys addressed to:
- operators (healthcare professionals working in rehabilitation)
- adult patients
- caregivers of adult patients
- caregivers of children

The repository contains two folders:
- In the <code>operator_surveys_analysis</code> folder, you can find Python scripts to analyse the results of the questionnaires dedicated to healthcare professionals.
- In the <code>patients_survey_analysis</code> folder, you can find Python scripts to analyse the results of the questionnaires dedicated to adult patients, caregivers of adults and caregivers of children.
